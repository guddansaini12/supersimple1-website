<h1>
   Shree Krishna 
</h1>

<p>
    Krishna is an important God (Param Brahma) in Hinduism. He is considered to have been an avatar of the Vishnu. Krishna is believed to have been a real being who took part in the war known as the Mahabharata. 
</p>

<p>
    He is a central character in the important Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna belonged to a nomadic tribe of Abhiras known as Sāttvatas who inhabited the country (Surasena Janapad) near Mathura.[1] These Sāttvatas or more properly the Yadavas of whom they were a branch were mentioned by Panini.[2] Hindu often consider him a warrior, hero, teacher and philosopher and a great leader. He defeated the cruel Abhira King Kansa,[3] who putted his sister, Devāki and her consort Vasudevā to jail.

<h2>
Shree krishna's life
</h2>

<p>
    A child, a brother, a charioteer, a warrior, a disciple, a guru, a cowherd, a messenger, the beloved of the gopis… Throughout his life, Krishna enacted so many roles—the whole time never forgetting that they were just that, roles and that his true nature was eternal, ever blissful consciousness.
</p>

<p>
    In this way, he was able to remain detached and thus perform flawlessly, never allowing the smile to fall from his face. This, Amma says, is perhaps his greatest teaching.
